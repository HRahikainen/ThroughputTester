# ThroughputTester

My demo code forked from [Silabs forum](https://www.silabs.com/community/wireless/bluetooth/knowledge-base.entry.html/2017/11/21/throughput_testerex-octu) for maintenance and further development. Documented also in the forum.

The throughput tester example application can be used to measure the Bluetooth connection bitrate when using Silicon Labs Bluetooth Low Energy stack. GATT operations, PHY and client device types (embedded, mobile, desktop) can be varied. Provides a basis for testing BLE range.
